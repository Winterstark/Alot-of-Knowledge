	'William Shakespeare - Macbeth (Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow)': "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury\nSignifying nothing.",
	'Charles Dickens - A Tale of Two Cities': 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.',
	'J. R. R. Tolkien - All that is gold does not glitter': 'All that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\n\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken,\nThe crownless again shall be king.',
