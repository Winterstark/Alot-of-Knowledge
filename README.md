Alot of Knowledge
==================

![Alot logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winterstark/Alot-of-Knowledge/master/alot.png)


This is a python script that helps the user learn stuff. It's basically the script equivalent of my [Wordy](https://github.com/Winterstark/Wordy) project, but used not just for learning new words, but for any kind of knowledge tidbit.

It supports the following data types:
* Number/date
* Tuple/date range
* String/definition/quote
* Picture (as path to an image file)
* Diagram
* List (of any of the previous types)
* Class (consisting of any number of the previous types)

This project is not meant to reach Wordy's scale and user-friendliness - for example, the user has to add new entries by manually editing text files (or using the add.py script). Since I doubt many people will be interested in using the script I won't go into explaining the details of how it works. If, however, there happen to be any interested people, send me a message and I'll write a decent README.
