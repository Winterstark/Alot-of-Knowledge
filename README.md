README STILL BEING WRITTEN



This is a python script that helps the user learn stuff. It's basically the script equivalent of my [https://github.com/Winterstark/Wordy](Wordy) project, but used not just for learning new words, but for any kind of knowledge tidbit.

It supports the following data types:
* Number/date
* Tuple/date range
* String/definition/quote
* Picture (as path to an image file)
* Diagram
* List (of any of the previous types)
* Class (consisting of any number of the previous types)
